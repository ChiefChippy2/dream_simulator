## Dream simulator
This program tries to mimic the ender pearl luck a youtuber called "[Dream](https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamTraps)" managed to get in his highly controversial 1.16 speedrun by running billions of simulations to try and match the luck gained in that speedrun.

You can see a demo of this in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF_YLrItRW0&t=745s&ab_channel=Basilicous)
